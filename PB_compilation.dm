#descr "The gifts of magic are granted to those of the Cults by the Forge of Souls, which empowers the chosen with wonderous power. When called to work their craft in times of war, the Soul Forgers of the Cults can draw out the souls of the heretic and the heathen, and reforge them in the image of the Forge's chosen, forever tethering it to the Soul Forge alongside the rest of the faithful. A strong will can resist the binding, but the Forgers are skillful in their craft and can perform their work upon multiple souls at once."

If its will is defied however, the malign aspect of the soul releases a spiteful burst of virulent death before withdrawing from the realm of the flesh."

Contracted are lighteyes who have other options in life but chose to sign on to fight for a multitude of reasons. Many feel the Alethi bloodthirst they call the Thrill during battle, a lust of blood that can't be quenched by anything less. They practice tirelessly with great axes that are pale imitations of shard blades so that when they enter battle they can drown themselves in the Thrill, then the enemy's entrails."

They are often the 2nd or 3rd born sons with little inheritance but plenty of financial support to bring glory to the family name on the field of battle. They are given the best equipment and training, and must personally tame a ferocious leogryph to earn the title. Still, there are worse fates than having the best and being the best."

#descr "Alethkar is a land of windswept hills periodically battered by brutal storms. Storms with such force that to be left out during one is a ritual death sentence. Storms so powerful it shapes the people, their architecture, their society and their religion. The storms are not without their benefits however; rich nutrients are churned up from the sea and deposited on the fields after each passing, and it ingrained a stubborn, never-surrender attitude in those who learned to survive it. Aelthi society is tiered, with the main separation by eye colours; those with bright colours are of a higher class than those of darkeyes. They are further divided into ten steps, for a total of twenty classes, with the Lighteye Highprince or Highprincess being at the top, or 1st Dahn, and a darkeyed criminal at the bottom, or 10th Nahn. Citizens can move up and down their rankings by behaviour, professional skills, and wealth. However, the gap between a lighteye and a darkeye may never be breached."

#descr "Though the Beastmen are generally loyal to Moreau and his commandments, exceptions do occur. A beastman who breaks the commandments will lose some of the gift of reason, becoming erratic and dangerous. Beastman soldiers are therefore not trusted to guard the cities of men, instead human enforcers are trained. 

They rely on two main lines of defense - firstly, they show no fear. This on it’s own can be enough to prevent an attack by a rogue beastman. Secondly, they carry crossbows and are exceptional marksmen. Beastmen soldiers are not given shields, so rogues are easy prey for their bolts. They carry swords as a last resort, though they are often unskilled in their use."

Larger beasts such as horses and oxen will often retain something of their size as a Beastman. Despite their affinity for manual labour, they are also recruited as soldiers, where they are given iron armour and expected to form the vanguard of the army."

Edward Prendick, Traveller. 

Each Beastman bears some legacy of its original form in its appearance, its movements and in its mannerisms. For the majority, this is perhaps more of a hindrance than a benefit. Considered expendable, they are dressed in furs that are made from the pelts shed during the transformation of animals into Beastmen, though the irony of this seems to be lost on them."

Edward Prendick, Traveller

Some few Beastmen distinguish themselves by retaining a greater part of the physical capabilities, reflexes and ferocity from their original form. Mostly originating from carnivorous hunting beasts, they form an elite force in the armies of Vivis, being granted the finest equipment and an untransformed, trained lion as a steed. The prestige of their role makes them arrogant when around their lesser brethren, though they remain subservient around humans."

#descr "The macabre aspect of the Revenants ended with the conclusion of the first crusades. Once the returning warriors discovered the methods employed to raise their fallen to fight again, they smote those immediately responsible for the practice before they were mollified by the Cult's Patriarchs. Now, a more elegant process has been developed- drawing upon the wellspring of energy that is the Soul Forge and enticing the souls of the fallen as they return to their immortal hearth, the masters of the Cult of Souls developed a way to create life from false bodies. Empowered by the souls of the zealous and the vengeful, and animated by the craft of the Forgers of Souls, the Revenants march to war again.

...

As they are merely vessels for the souls inhabiting them, Revenants are devoid of most emotions or interests. During times of rest between marches and battles, they often spend their time aiding in rudimentary tasks about the encampment, or simply amble about. Interestingly however, they consistently display a very specific habit whenever the army is encamped along any substantial body of water. Every single able-bodied Revenant will doggedly search for mollusks. They will spend every waking hour doing this until the army prepares to march again, nearly without exception. As such, most commanders generally try to position their encampments away from lakes or coastlines whenever Revenants are within their ranks, as they will entirely ignore any attempts to gain their assistance in their usual labors whenever this 'opportunity' is made available to them.

Oh and they fly. Because we said so. Don't think too hard about their weapons either."

Those whose potency stems from the Forge's aspects of zeal and war are then drawn into the Firebrand Cult as they reach adolescence, and are taught its tenants and rites throughout their youths. Eventually, these marked clergymen and women are inducted into the Firebrand Cult's Apostlery, and are sent out to do the work of the faithful, and bring glory to the Cults in the name of the Forge of Souls.

#descr "Rarely, a man is deemed worthy of both the mark of the firebrand cult as well as the rites of soul forging. Where once the rituals of the patriarchs stripped away the magic from the chosen in order to ensure they retained the balance of the cults' powers within their mortal flesh, the reaffirming of the Duality after the end of the first crusades instigated the primacy of the Firebrand Cult in the judgement they laid upon those of the Cult of Souls. Now, with the concerns of such schism quelled and made obsolete, the Patriarchs are capable of retaining their abilities throughout the rites of their hallowed order. However, while their magical potency remains, it is rare that a patriarch now emerges from the rituals with the same kind of divine strength that they once universally commanded. But even so, they do command it still. A Patriarch is transcendent among their peers, as to become such a paragon is to be honored as the most worthy of the Forge's divine favor-- and their souls imbued with a small measure of the wrath of God itself."

The simulacrums do nothing and so over a decade or two the Piercers adapt to a sightless world, to the point that through perhaps even magical means they can fire a bow at a target. Notorious for missing, they are jokingly called Earth Piercers due to the amount of arrows that miss."

At first they were kept as sacred remnants of the past, but when the bells of war rang and crises assaulted Tloaf again, they were taken into laboratories and distilled. The concentrated solution that resulted spreads anguish beyond reason to those contacting it. Most claw out their eyes and swiftly succumb to the same condition as their progenitors. There are others who survive and live agonized for the rest of their days, and often sign into the armies of Tloaf to die.

But their real strength comes instead from their resistance to fire and shock. An anomaly among normal Tloafans, Floating Guardians have to ingest a variety of alchemical potions and have much surgery performed before they can resist both lightning and high temperatures. As a side effect, they are also much more hardy. But as with most things these boons come at a cost, and the Floating Guardians are perpetually hungry, eating twice the amount of food a normal Tlaofan does. The mages of Tloaf work round the clock to try and develop a better solution to the threat of enemy archers but the crude mutagenics have so far been the only effective solution."

#descr "Tloaf was once a great empire, but they searched too deep into the secrets of the earth and all who touched the ground were killed by that which shall not be named who dwells deep. The Twsnbnwdd, as it came to be called, was never defeated, only bypassed through the emergency usage of air magic. But the Tloafans were untrained in this art, and forever changed their bodies into masses of floating flesh to escape the calamity. This led to a development of a culture of mass batch mutations, and now extra arms and strange properties are common in subsections of tailor made bodies. As most of the tools for experimentation were lost to the Twsnbnwdd the mutations are crude. Only in The Floating Complex are the mutations truly understood, but the practices are very much habitual outside the capital.

In the decades since the attack of the Twsnbnwdd, the people of Tloaf have never forgotten the lore that lead to their transformation. Earth magic is still commonly practiced and studied, for to give up after the attack would be admitting defeat and weakness to the Twsnbnwdd. Now the Tloafans hear the word the Awakening God and march forth from the Floating Complex."

Nothing is safe from the Heralds’ corruptive touch: by summoning otherworldly might, they can turn air into deadly poisonous mist, earth into clinging mud, and fine iron weapons into rusted wrecks. Most infamous of all, however, is their ability to warp the flesh and humours of living beings, such that many of them are themselves mutated in some way.

When magic was released into the world, a disease of incredible ferocity swept over the countryside, slaying thousands. In desperation, many turned to human sacrifice, hoping to appease the unseen reaper with the gift of blood. The gruesome libations drew the attention of Nuvorok, a wicked infernal spirit, who appeared in dreams to the priests and wise men of Egeros and offered them a pact. In exchange for their worship, he would grant them the power to manipulate the humours of the body and save their people from the illness. With this arcane knowledge, the disease was halted, but Nuvorok’s insidious influence twisted his followers into a cruel cult that inflicts foul mutations on its thralls. Now the people of Egeros draw strength from their afflictions, and seek to claim the world in the name of their fiendish master." -- The blurb that shows directly above the recruitment options when you select the nation, usually detailing infrastucture costs
